# Here was a Project I did regarding NFL Player Stats leveraging Clustering using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project that applies machine learning techniques to cluster NFL player statistics. The goal is to group players based on their performance metrics, which can help in identifying patterns and similarities between different players.

## Project Overview

The project uses various clustering algorithms to analyze NFL player statistics. The key steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering NFL player statistics from a reliable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may enhance the clustering process.
4. **Clustering**: Applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the clustering models and visualizing the results.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and discussing potential applications (and draft an awesome fantasy football team)!
